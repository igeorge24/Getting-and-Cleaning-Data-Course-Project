# Code Book for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Study Design

A detailed description of the study design is found in the README.txt file in the downloaded data folder "./getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset/UCI HAR Dataset", but will be briefly summarized here. The study involved experiments where 30 volunteers between ages 19-48 year each performed six activites (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) while wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II). The linear acceleration and angular velocity measurements were recorded at a rate of 50 Hz during these activity experiments by the smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope. The experiments were videotaped to label the data. The dataset was randomly separated and assigned to two datasets named test data (30% of volunteers) and training data (70% of volunteers) found in the test and train subfolders. Further signal pre-processing of the data by the researchers was detailed in the README.txt file.

## Tidy Data Selection and Cleanup

The raw signals from the accelerometer and gyroscope recorded during the experiments were used to estimate the features included in the dataset. The features dataset included a 561 feature vector for each record that correspond to time and frequency domain variables. These are listed in the features.txt file and described in detail in the features_info.txt file. For this course project, the test and train datasets were combined with the subject identifier information and activity labels into one dataset. The 86 mean (all variables that include "mean" or "Mean") and standard deviation (std()) variables were selected from the 561 features variables, which are listed below under Code Book of Variables subsection. The features were then averaged for each volunteer subject and activity and written to a text file tidy_data.txt. 

## Code Book of Variables

Here is a list of variables included in the tidy_data.txt file. The first two variables are identifiers of the subject ("Subject_ID") and activity label ("Activity"). The next 86 variables represent estimates of the mean and std features averaged by subject and activity. Further details describing the features is found in the features_info.txt.
